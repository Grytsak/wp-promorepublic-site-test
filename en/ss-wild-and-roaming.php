                        idea - that rather than tight and restricting, these are clothes<br/>

                        products for women. I love the community that this company<br/>

                        S. This company is pretty new - I just bought it in September<br/>
                        2017, so I am not yet doing events, wholesale or anything like<br/>
                        that, so social media makes up the majority of my marketing.<br/>
                        Initially, though, yes… we had to figure out which actions would<br/>
                        have the most impact and how to get people engaged.

                        S. Face-to-face networking is also starting to have an impact.<br/>
                        My first social media goal is to continue to grow my Instagram<br/>
                        following and become far more proficient at using and<br/>
                        expanding my business through that platform.

                        S. Yes, when I took over, customers were already on the<br/>
                        Facebook page, giving us feedback and basically becoming<br/>
                        members of this community that we needed to foster or lose<br/>
                        out on ASAP. But it’s difficult for me, social media….<br/>
                        I’m overwhelmed with unrelated tasks or other marketing<br/>
                        requirements and have trouble getting organized or learning<br/>
                        how to effectively utilize the available platforms, cutting<br/>
                        through the noise and figuring out what actions will have the<br/>
                        most impact, you know? When I started, I could see we had<br/>
                        a decent start but really needed to do a better job getting<br/>
                        people to engage.

                        pull a great quote from their Post Ideas section that I know<br/>
                        will speak to our base. Often, though, it’s to do a straight-up<br/>

                        with inspirational quotes and a picture of beautiful scenery.<br/>
                        Hiking trails tend to hit the jackpot on instagram, in terms of likes<br/>
                        and shares. Posts with photos of women on adventures speak to<br/>
                        them and do pretty well. And, of course, it’s completely on-brand,<br/>
                        especially with the leggings in the image.

                        S. I am still very much of a beginner, but I do know that consistency<br/>
                        is key as well as the need to balance social media posts.<br/>
                        They should not all be about promoting a product.<br/>
                        Sales will come if the page is strong and the audience feedback<br/>
                        produces more great content, products and giveaways<br/>
                        that they appreciate.

                        Those social posts should very much be about strong content<br/>
                        fostering engagement. I try to only post promotional content<br/>
                        two or three times a week. The rest of my posts are just<br/>
                        straight content.
