                        North South Physical Therapy centre from Massachusetts feels
                        like a home away from home. Their social media goal was to create a
                        live educational centre for their clients - “We always struggled to
                        become something bigger, to get beyond promotion.
                        Here at North South we wanted to educate our followers - <b>became an educational and
                            inspirational place for our clients</b>. So we went social!”

                        Their mission was to create an online community feel with their customers, much like
                        they have in their physical centre. Setting up a Facebook Page was the first step where
                        their fans could comment and share posts, see upcoming events and
                        get involved in their care centre activities.

                    <p class="ss-content__text">
                        Once the Page was up, they relied on content, posting, and promotion: “Our customers
                        come to us for help and guidance. We want to be able to share our knowledge with
                        professional visuals and reliable benefits and tips”
