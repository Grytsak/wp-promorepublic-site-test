                    Presenting New Product to the Market

                <p class="ss-content__text">
                    The Big Cheezy sprang up in an unassuming building in the middle of New Orleans
                    and became a major hotspot for lunch in New Orleans. Cheezy doesn’t just sell plain
                    old grilled cheese sandwiches. What makes them unique is that they only sell grilled
                    cheese and variations on it. “We are not a standard eatery, we are building
                    a completely new vision on this simple food.”
                </p>
                <p class="ss-content__text">
                    The company’s social media goal was to tell the world about their new product
                    and attract more clients to come and try their grilled cheese sandwiches.

                        Instead of disappearing for days until another promotion was<br/>
                        ready, they frequently engaged with customers, posting in the<br/>
                        comments, even “cracking wise if someone was making jokes, so<br/>

                        of the item.” To cut through the competitive social media <br/>
                        algorithms, they spent $25 on a Facebook ad, simply of a photo of a<br/>
                        delicious, stuffed grilled cheese sandwich. “This lead to a domino<br/>
                        effect where we got a lot of free publicity from people who saw<br/>
                        the ad because they would tag their friends or even just send<br/>
